# WishingWell

Wishlists are collections of products an individual would like purchased for them for an event such as:
 -	Christmas
 - Birthdays
 -	Valentine's Day
 -	Anniversaries
 -	Easter

And many more occasions
Currently, there exists no easily accessible, intuitive and aesthetically pleasing software product that allows individuals to create and share their own personalised wishlists to their friends and family. 

# Target Audience
The target audience consists of anyone over the age of 14, as that is the age that they would most likely have their own (or school issued) laptop, and by that age are computer literate. 14 is alÂ¬so the age that teenagers begin to want more control and independence in their life, for example: having input in their presents.
